## Abstract
**Databaseball** is an interactive baseball statistics search engine that combines a **custom PostgreSQL database**, **daily-updating ETL pipelines**, and **natural language query translation**.  

The goal of the project is to make baseball data more accessible by allowing users to ask questions in plain English and receive accurate, data-driven answers backed by curated datasets.  

Key data sources include:  
- **Lahman Baseball Database** (historical stats)  
- **FanGraphs** (advanced batting and pitching statistics)  
- **Statcast** (daily pitch- and play-level data via `pybaseball`)  

---

## Features
- **Custom PostgreSQL Database**: Integrates historical, advanced, and live baseball data.  
- **Automated ETL Pipelines**: GitHub Actions + AWS RDS for daily FanGraphs and Statcast updates.  
- **Natural Language to SQL**: Uses LLMs to translate user questions into database queries.  
- **Interactive App**: Built with Streamlit for live querying and visualization.  
- **Data Normalization**: Unified schema ensures player stats are comparable across sources.  

---

## Results
- Successfully integrated Lahman, FanGraphs, and Statcast into one database.  
- Automated daily data updates with robust ETL pipelines.  
- Deployed an interactive web app where users can explore baseball data with **natural language queries**.  
- Produced visualizations and tables on-demand directly from the database.  

---

## Future Work
- Expand LLM prompt templates for more complex baseball queries.  
- Add team- and season-level summary dashboards.  
- Improve efficiency of daily ETL updates and scale database for larger Statcast coverage.  
- Extend the framework to additional sports datasets.
